# Twitter Data Collector
This respository consists of Python/JavaScript files that allows users to identify their bearer token (application-only authentication), collect Tweets using Twitter's premium search endpoints and aggregate Tweets into one file for analysis purposes.

## Why should I use this endpoint? 
Utilizing Twitter's Premium Search API is particularly useful in a research context as it allows you to collect full-fidelity data that can be replicated by others.
