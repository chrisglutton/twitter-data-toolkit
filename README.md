# Twitter Data Toolkit

'twitter-data-app' is a Node.js project that allows users to identify their bearer token (application-only authentication), collect Tweets using Twitter's premium search endpoints and aggregate Tweets into one JSON file for analysis purposes without having to interact with code. Everything's done through a simple web application.
